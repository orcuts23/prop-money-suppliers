# Latest Prop Money Suppliers Roundup (Including Legal Compliance Details)

Ever had to halt a shoot because your fake cash looked too fake on camera, or worse—too real and the Secret Service showed up? Finding prop money that hits that sweet spot between realistic cinematography and legal compliance isn't as simple as printing bills at home. Federal regulations require specific design elements, and using non-compliant fake currency can shut down your entire production and land you in serious trouble.

Quality prop money suppliers understand these legal requirements while delivering bills that look authentic under studio lighting and high-resolution cameras. Whether you're shooting a heist scene, music video, or YouTube content, the right supplier provides fast shipping, bulk quantities, and various bill types—from full-print stacks to blank filler bundles—without risking legal issues.

Prop Money specializes in their RealAged™ technique that gives bills natural-looking wear and tear resembling cash that's been circulating for years. This proprietary aging process makes the money look lived-in rather than fresh-from-the-mint, adding authenticity to scenes requiring used currency. Available denominations include $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills in various configurations.

The product lineup covers different budget needs. Full-print bills feature detailed printing on both front and back, ideal for close-up shots where both sides might be visible. Blank filler options reduce costs by placing realistic full-print bills on top and bottom of stacks while interior bills remain blank—perfect for wide shots or scenes where only the stack's exterior appears on camera.

Configuration options include stacks of 100 bills secured with money bands, folded bands held with rubber bands, and bundles consisting of multiple stacks rubber-banded together. Custom design services let you create personalized bills with specific images or text for special events, celebrations, or unique production needs.

The Southern California facility handles both small orders and bulk requests with quick turnaround. Walk-in pickup available for local productions on tight schedules. Regular sales offer significant discounts, with pricing frequently dropping to 50% off standard rates.

Prop Movie Money has supplied fake currency for over a decade to major productions including Netflix shows, Marvel films, and viral content from Mr. Beast, SNL, Kendrick Lamar, and Rihanna. The company works directly with US law enforcement and prop masters to ensure all products meet federal compliance standards while maintaining cinematic realism.

Bills are color-graded to look realistic in 8K resolution, addressing the challenge of modern cameras capturing increasing detail. Non-glossy finish prevents unnatural shine under studio lighting. Both blank filler and full-print options accommodate different budget levels and shooting requirements.

The facility maintains full inventory and stays equipped to handle orders of any size—from small independent projects to stadium-scale productions requiring vast quantities. Express and overnight shipping available for productions on compressed timelines. International orders supported with competitive shipping rates.

## **[ISS Props](https://issprops.com)**

Industry veteran prop house providing comprehensive production support beyond currency.

ISS Props operates as one of Hollywood's largest prop houses with locations across 11 cities in the US and Europe. Founded decades ago, the company supplies props for nearly every major blockbuster and television show, from *90210* to *Indiana Jones* to *Ozark*. Their money prop department is just one facet of a massive inventory exceeding one million items.

The company offers both standard-grade bills for wide shots and high-grade bills for close-ups. Standard bills look realistic from distance but include obvious modifications up close—altered portraits, simplified text, and prominent "for motion picture use only" markings. High-grade bills are printed on one side only to meet federal requirements while maintaining perfect visual accuracy from the printed side.

An alternative approach uses real currency strategically—placing genuine bills on top and bottom of stacks while interior bills remain blank. This method ensures perfect realism for shots showing stack exteriors without the cost or security risk of solid real-money stacks.

After the notorious *Rush Hour 2* incident where extras took prop bills from set and attempted spending them, ISS refined their designs and compliance processes. The company maintains ongoing communication with federal authorities to ensure products meet evolving legal standards.

Founder Rich "RJ" Rappaport spent three years working with the Secret Service to develop prop money designs that satisfy both cinematic needs and federal compliance. That kind of direct agency guidance is uncommon, but the resulting products balance realism with legal safety.

Full-print new bills feature printing on both sides with $100 denominations available in realistic stacks. The inventory also includes working practical props like fully equipped operating rooms, computer labs with functioning servers, airport security equipment, and vintage broadcasting cameras from classic shows.

## Is buying and owning prop money legal?

Yes, owning and using prop money is legal for entertainment, educational, and non-commercial purposes including film production, magic acts, YouTube videos, and theatrical performances. Props must meet federal design requirements including obvious differences from real currency and cannot be used to purchase goods or services.

## What's the difference between full-print and blank filler bills?

Full-print bills feature detailed printing on both front and back, necessary for close-up shots where both sides might be visible. Blank filler stacks place realistic full-print bills on top and bottom while interior bills remain blank, reducing costs for wide shots where only the stack's exterior appears on camera.

## How do I avoid legal problems with prop money?

Purchase only from established suppliers who work with law enforcement to ensure compliance with federal counterfeiting laws. Prop money must include obvious design differences from real currency, be printed on one side only or have clear markings, and never be used to attempt purchases. Avoid cheap imports that may violate US regulations.
